## Assignment 2

This repository contains the final code for this modules 2nd assignment. The model developed here is an Agent Based Model which simulates agents as 'drunk people' moving within the town 'environment' from pubs to their homes. 

The model:

- Reads in the environment file as 'TownPlan.txt' 
- Calculates where in the town the pubs and homes are located. 
- Models the drunk agents leaving the pub they start in and reaching their homes by simulating them to move across the       environment randomly until they get home.
- Once all the drunk agents are home the model stores how many drunks have passed through each point on the map.
- Creates a density map showing the drunk agents passing through each point on a map.
- Saves the density map to the file 'walked_environment_output.csv'.
- When the model has finished running a window appears with a figure showing the drunk agents in their homes.
